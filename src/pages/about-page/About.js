            <p className='about-body'>Im Bat, a 21-year old photographer and fashion designer based in Roanoke, Virginia. Iâ€™ve been an artist my whole life, dabbling in writing, painting, dance, and everything in between before I found my calling in photography. I started officially working towards this business in 2022, and got my kickstart as the head photographer for Roanoke Fashion Week. I am co-founder of Haus of the Star, a fashion collective for Roanoke creatives.</p>
            <p className='about-body'>Being an artist at heart, I specialize in the fine art style of photography. I aim to explore a concept or story in each shoot that uniquely complements my subject. I particularly like to work with fantastical or gothic themes. My style is most suited to portraits, but I carry this approach to my fashion and event photography as well. My goal is to portray feeling in every shot.</p>
            <p className='about-body'>Fashion has always been my first love, and I express my alternative style through my fashion brand, BATZ. I create one-of-a-kind unique pieces from upcycled clothing, each collection revolving around a different theme. In the goal of sustainable fashion, each piece is made from 100% thrifted or deadstock fabric.</p>
